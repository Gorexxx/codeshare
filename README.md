# ShareCodeTogether

### What's in this project:

This project is a web application that is based around dynamically generated rooms that can be shared by multiple users to write text simultaneously. Room progress can be saved on the server to revisit the room later with its content preserved.

### This project was created using **React** and JavaScript.
Other important packages include react-router for navigation and node-sass for styling.

It was one of my first projects, created purely for educational purposes. Whole idea for it was taken from https://codeshare.io/ and the main goal was to create something similar.
